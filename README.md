Generates standard stuff on top of README.md. In fact, this file (the top of it)
is generated by readmeify.

The format is highly opinionated. It places the badges on line 3, right after a
heading and a horizontal line. The `.travis.yml` file is told to run `npm test`
if generated by this tool.

### @Todo
- More tests.
- More unicorny badges.

### Contribute
If you want to add some more badges, add some config to make this less
opinionated, think the code stinks or something completely different - pull
requests are of course welcome.

### Tests
Tests are run with mocha, and starts if you just type `make test`.
